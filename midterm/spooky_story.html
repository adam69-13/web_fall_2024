    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: larger; color: orange;">The Wisphering Woods</p>
    <p>By:ChatGPT/Adam Hagen</p>

<p>       There’s an old legend about the Whispering Woods, a stretch of dense forest on the outskirts of town. No one dares to enter after dark, but on Halloween, the place comes alive in a way that keeps even the bravest at bay. Kids in the neighborhood tell stories of eerie sounds and ghostly figures that haunt the woods, but most think it’s just a tall tale.
        
    Until last Halloween, that is.</p>
        
        <p>A group of friends—Lily, Max, and Jake—dared each other to explore the woods on Halloween night. They'd laughed it off, thinking they were too old to be scared. But as the clock struck midnight, the three of them found themselves at the edge of the woods, flashlights in hand, the bravado slowly fading.</p>
        
        <p>"Come on, it’s just trees," Max scoffed, though his voice wavered. They took their first steps into the forest, where shadows seemed to stretch and shift with each flicker of their lights.</p>
        
        <p>As they ventured deeper, they noticed an unsettling quiet. Not a single rustle, no animal noises. Just silence. Lily glanced back, but the path they’d entered from had vanished, swallowed by darkness.</p>
        
        <p>“Didn’t we come from there?” she whispered, pointing to what seemed like a different direction.</p>
        
        <p>“No… we came from… over here, I think?” Jake muttered, spinning his flashlight around, the beam catching on fog that clung low to the ground.</p>
        
       <p> They continued, trying to retrace their steps. The air grew colder, thick with an odd, sickly sweet smell. Suddenly, a voice, faint but clear, whispered through the trees.</p>
        
       <p> “Welcome… back.” </p>
        
       <p>The three froze, their flashlights bobbing as their hands shook. The voice sounded like it was coming from every direction, whispering in a low, rhythmic hum. Panic surged in their chests.</p>
        
       <p> “Hello?” Max called out, his voice cracking. </p>
        
      <p>  There was no response. But then, the whispers grew louder, shifting from one side of the woods to the other, as if something unseen was circling them.</p>
        
      <p>  They turned to run, but the path twisted on itself, leading them deeper into the heart of the woods. Tree branches reached out like claws, snagging their clothes and hair. The fog thickened, distorting the beams of their flashlights. Ahead, they saw an old, decrepit cabin with a single light flickering in the window.</p>
        
        <p>“Maybe someone there can help us,” Lily whispered, though she doubted her own words.</p>
        
       <p> They approached the cabin, the wood creaking as they stepped onto the porch. Just as Jake reached for the door, it swung open on its own, revealing a dim room filled with strange, ancient artifacts.</p>

       <p> At the center of the room stood a figure cloaked in black, hooded with its back turned. Slowly, it turned to face them, but beneath the hood was nothing but darkness, save for two hollow, empty eyes.</p>
        
       <p> “You’ve returned,” it rasped, its voice the same as the whispers in the woods. “But this time… you will stay.”</p>
        
       <p> The door slammed shut behind them, and the woods outside erupted into a frenzy of whispering voices, each one begging to be let out. The kids tried the door, the windows, but every escape had sealed shut, trapping them in the cabin, where the figure stood motionless, watching. </p>
        
       <p>And the Whispering Woods fell silent once again.</p>
